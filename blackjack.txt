For this assignment, I first started off creating a function for drawing cards because that was going to be used a lot in the main function.  I then I printed the welcome to blackjack sign, drew the frist card, andprinting out what the first card is.  After that, I checked if the card was one and gave the option to the user if they wanted to make the value one or eleven.  After that, I did a while loop that draws another
card and prints what the total value is.  I also made it so that if any card was a king, queen, or jack, the card value will always be 10. I also added to that if it is an ace it does the same things as the first time.  After that, I used continue to repeat the while loop, but if you bust over 21, then the whole program stops.  The while loop will keep going until either you give 0 so that it moves onto the dealers turn, or you bust.  When it moves onto the dealers turn, the dealer draws as long as his total is under17, but if it goes over 21, the player wins.  Finally I add other if statements for if the player wins, ties, or loses to the dealer.
