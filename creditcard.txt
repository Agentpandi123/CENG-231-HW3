I first ask the user to input credit limit, current balance, annual percentage rate (APR) and monthly payment.  I then define my variables and make them floats because dollar amounts are in float.  I then print outthe month, balance, interest, payment, and new balance.  After that, I start a while loop that calculates and prints the amount for each category.  Within the while statement, I put an if statement as well to say if the new balance is less than 0, then the new payment will be the last balance plus the interest and then quits the while loop.  To make everything lined up, I put a tab after each printed number and used .2f to
print only thw first 2 decimal places.  After that, I add the payment and balance to make the final print statement.
